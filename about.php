			<h3>OUR HISTORY</h3>
		<p><b>1976–1984: Founding and incorporation</b><br>

In 1976, Steve Jobs co-founded Apple in his parents' home on Crist Drive in Los Altos, California.Although it is widely believed that the company was founded in the house's garage, Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak called it "a bit of a myth".Jobs and Wozniak did, however, move some operations to the garage when the bedroom became too crowded.
Apple's first product, the Apple I, invented by Steve Wozniak, was sold as an assembled circuit board and lacked basic features such as a keyboard, monitor, and case.<br><br>
<b>1984–1991: Success with Macintosh</b><br>
The Macintosh, released in 1984, is the first mass-market personal computer to feature an integral graphical user interface and mouse.
In 1984, Apple launched the Macintosh, the first personal computer to be sold without a programming language.Its debut was signified by "1984", a $1.5 million television advertisement directed by Ridley Scott.<br><br>
<b>2007–2011: Success with mobile devices</b><br>
During his keynote speech at the Macworld Expo on January 9, 2007, Jobs announced that Apple Computer, Inc. would thereafter be known as "Apple Inc.", because the company had shifted its emphasis from computers to consumer electronics.This event also saw the announcement of the iPhone and the Apple TV.The company sold 270,000 iPhone units during the first 30 hours of sales,and the device was called "a game changer for the industry".
